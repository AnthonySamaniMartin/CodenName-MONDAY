San Diego’s Premiere Home Buyer
Founded by the Flip this House stars JD Esajian and Than Merrill, CT Homes has been buying houses for over 15 years and have been helping sellers exclusively in San Diego for the better part of a decade. In that time we’ve built knowledge-base when it comes to buying homes and transforming them for future families.

We are fortunate to say that San Diego is our home and we pride ourselves on rejuvenating and uplifting the city one property at a time.

How we can help:
Pay cash for houses in any condition
Buy properties As-Is, no repairs necessary
Close quickly and/or flexibly if desired
Give sellers the ability to leave behind any unwanted personal belongings
Practice ethics and integrity to create smooth transactions and happy sellers
